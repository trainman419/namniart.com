   Programming Internship – I developed graphical design tools for thin film filter design, including the creation of a new filter design generation algorithm, implemented in Matlab. These tools are still in use today.
   
## Projects
 * *Dagny*: Created in 2008, Dagny is an autonomous mobile robot built on an RC car chassis, including electronic system design, sensor and controller selection, software and firmware.
   * All of the firmware on Dagny is written from scratch in AVR C.
   * The software is a combination of custom software and existing ROS nodes.
   * Dagny competed in Sparkfun's Autonomous Vehicle Competition in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and won the Engineer's Choice award in 2012.
   * Dagny competed in Robomagellan at Robogames in 2012 and 2013.
   * Dagny has been a research platform for:
     * Running ROS on small robots
     * Running ROS on ARM
     * ROS navigation on a car-like robot
     * Outdoor navigation
   
 * [*ROS builds for ARM*](http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/UbuntuARM): Running a build farm to do ROS builds for ARM, in support of Dagny and for the greater ROS community. Builds are public and have an estimated 50-100 users. http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/UbuntuARM
   
 * [*Xbee shell (xbsh)*](https://github.com/trainman419/xbee): A configuration tool for Digi Xbee radios, to make them easier to use and interact with. Written in C++, using readline for input, history and custom tab-completion. https://github.com/trainman419/xbee

 * [*python-cec*](https://github.com/trainman419/python-cec): A python library for CEC, the HDMI control protocol. It is wrapper around the libCEC library, and can be used to write scripts to control a home theater system.
