When I first assembled the robot, I was in a bit of a hurry to get it done before break was over, so I didn't take as many pictures as I should have of the assembly process. Tonight, as part of resolving another bug, I had to disassemble most of the robot, so I decided to do a little cleanup while I was at it and document the parts and the assembly procedure. So, here it is!

All of the parts that are go into the center of the robot.
