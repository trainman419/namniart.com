You can find Corey's article which initiates the "Learn To Type Correctly Week" here: [http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2010/07/learn-to-type-week.html](http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2010/07/learn-to-type-week.html)

I decided to do a few typing tests from [Free Typing Game](
http://www.freetypinggame.net/default.asp)

The tests I chose were "#26 - The classic story of a shoemaker and his magical elf helpers" and "#24 - Numbers".

I started a pomodoro and began typing test #26. When I completed it, I realized that I had not covered my hands like
Corey suggested. So, after covering my hands with a t-shirt, I started again!

For each of the tests I chose a five minute round. I performed three tests throughout the pomodoro.

The results went like this:

    #26 - 70WPM (uncovered)
    #26 - 74WPM (covered)
    #24 - 9WPM

Okay, as the results conclude: I'm not the best typist! I mean 9WPM on numbers is pretty awful and 74WPM is not good.

Well, I'm an optimist and I'm looking forward to the next four days of Learning To Type Correctly!
