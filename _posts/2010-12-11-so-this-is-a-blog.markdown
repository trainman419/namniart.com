Every once in a while, I think "I might be able to write a blog post about this," and now that the quarter is over and I have a modicum of free time, I figure I'll set it up and see what I can do with it.

I've chosen to run the blog on WordPress for now, but I'm willing to consider and try other things if they seem good or if I just get bored with WordPress.
