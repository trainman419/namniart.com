## Farewell packages.namniart.com

The time has come to retire packages.namniart.com. There hasn't been a need to upload any updated packages in years, and traffic has been steadily declining, from 200GB/year when I first set up the server, to just over 500MB over the past year; with all of the recent traffic requests for the directory index and web crawlers. I haven't added any new ROS releases or Ubuntu releases in many years, and traffic on the old releases is non-existent at this point.

The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) has been maintaining the ARM builds for ROS over the past 6 or 7 years, and continues to maintain builds of the latest [ROS 1 LTS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu), [ROS 2 LTS](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) and [ROS 2 latest release](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). 

I've hosted packages.namniart.com out of my personal budget since the beginning, and it's time to retire it and reclaim a small part of that budget. I don't expect very many people to notice, but figued I'd make a quick blog post to announce the shutdown.

I have a complete backup of the server if it becomes necessary. If you have urgent need of the files that were hosted there, please email me and we can work something out.
