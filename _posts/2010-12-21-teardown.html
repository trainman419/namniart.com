<p>
The time has come to take everything I learned last quarter and condense it into new hardware and software for the robot.
First, I have to remove all of the old control hardware, to make way for the new.
Without further ado, the robot, with all of the old control hardware removed:
</p>

<p>The center of the robot. With the electronics and batteries removed, there's a lot of space.</p>

<p>The front of the robot, with the old LED bar and driver board removed to make way for mounts for a Kinect or a laser scanner.</p>

<p>All of the old hardware that was removed.<p>

<p>Roughly clockwise from lower left:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sonar interface and level conversion breadboard, including 5V regulator.
<li>Polybot 1.0 board and mouting bracket.
<li>LED bar and driver board.
<li>Bluetooth radio module.
<li>Propeller proto board.
<li>The tiny HM55B compass module.
</ul>

<p>And the new hardware that's going to replace all of that and the Android phone.</p>

<p>Roughly clockwise from bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALIX.3D2 Motherboard
<li>Arduino Mega 2560
<li>40x2 LCD display. Not sure if I'm going to include this or not.
<li>Bluetooth radio module.
<li>The tiny HM55B compass.
<li>New sonar interface chip and board.
<li>GPS module.
</ul>

<p>
That's all for now; the next post will probably be ideas and designs for new mounting brackets and layouts.
