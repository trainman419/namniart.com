    "You can call it a nervous habit, a disgusting habit, or even an expression of self-mutilation. 
     The truth is that breaking the habit felt almost effortless." -- Lake Denman

I am absolutely convinced that the cure to my nail biting stemmed from the following, in order of importance:

    * Diet enriched with vitamins and minerals
    * Sending signals to my brain that nail biting is bad via bitter tasting nail polish

It has been said that nail biting is caused by a nutrient deficiency. I decided to test this theory and the results were incredible! I&#8217;ll recommend the exact nutrients I have been using for a few weeks that have, honestly, changed my life. I bought mine via Amazon, so I&#8217;ll post the links here:

## My Recipe

    * Blend my favorite fruits and vegetables in a smoothie
    * Mix in the Spirulina and the Colloidal Minerals, as directed by the label
    * Do this on a daily basis
    * Note that I could mix in with plain water, juice, soup, etc.
    * Apply the Mavala Stop Nail Biting polish daily to each nail</code></pre>

## Conclusion

<p>I am happy to announce that I clipped my fingernails for the first time in my life today. It seems unbelievable, but it&#8217;s really true. I can only hope that I have given some advice that will help any nail biters out there overcome their habit. I know most of the time breaking the habit feels extremely difficult, but I believe that with a better diet and some re-inforcement, the habit can be broken almost effortlessly!</p>
