Tom Preston-Werner's [_Blogging Like a Hacker_](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) should be an inspiration while learning Jekyll. Also, Basil Shkara's [_Overview of Jekyll_](http://www.oiledmachine.com/posts/2008/12/27/overview-of-jekyll--a-static-site-generator-written-in-ruby.html) is informative, as it lists reasons why one might want to use Jekyll, some trouble you will want to watch out for, and a lesson on getting started with Jekyll. 

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages.
