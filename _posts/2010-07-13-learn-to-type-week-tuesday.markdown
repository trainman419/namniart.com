Well, I made it. Day two of the "Learn To Type Correctly Week"

Today I decided to use the trusty [http://freetypinggame.net](http://freetypinggame.net), just as I used yesterday.
I tried my hand at typing tests #27 and #24.

It seems that I improved slightly on test #24. If you recall from yesterday, my stats look like this:

    Monday
    #26 - 70WPM (uncovered)
    #26 - 74WPM (covered)
    #24 - 9WPM
              
I was able to improve #24 by just a few WPM.

    Tuesday
    #24 - 12WPM
    #27 - 68WPM

Unfortunately, I seem to have dropped a couple of words on #27. I had trouble sleeping last night and I was feeling groggy! 
I'm guessing I'll have some improvement on numbers and stories tomorrow. I'll probably play some typing games and then take the tests. Check back tomorrow for a report.
