And here comes day 3 of the Learn to type correctly week.

Perhaps I'm a bit lame, but I've been sticking the same old freetypinggame.net website
all week.

I saw a nice improvement today while practicing my numbers.

    Yesterday
    Numbers Test #24 - 12WPM
    Test #26 - 68WPM 

    Today
    Numbers Test #24 - 21WPM
    Test #26 - 74WPM 


I haven't quite been able to get above on the tests, but I'm still practicing!

A notable encounter today was when I hopped on [http://play.typeracer.com/](http://play.typeracer.com/) and was challenged by [Aimee Daniels](http://edendevelopment.co.uk/blogs/aimee/). She beat me each time we played, but we both expressed areas where we needed practice in the chat. It was nice to be able to race her as I have been reading her recent posts. Keep up the good work, Aimee! I'm sure you'll hit you're goal of 100WPM!

As for me, I'll be participating for the rest of the week as we learn to type better and faster.
