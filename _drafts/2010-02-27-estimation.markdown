title: Planning poker
excerpt: A point system for estimating features
---
 
1/3 of the room knows about "Planning poker"
Two types of estimation: 

Planning poker
  - How many engineers?
  - How long?

Some Agile teams use planning poker

"What is the security risk"

So, you have a new project and you're wondering when it should be released. 

There is a point system. Estimation is done is story points.

Planning poker is a relative measure. You determine endpoints. 

If there is no information, you can't really estimate. 

Planning poker is about constraining values. Estimate stories are relative to each other. 

  - Twice as big
  - Half as big
  - Almost but not quite as big
  - A little bit bigger
  
Only values available during estimation:
  - 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100
  
8 means "I can finish this in 1 iteration"

Above 8 means "I can't finish this in 1 iteration"

The team sits around the table and talks about the requirements. Everyone needs to be there so that there are many perspectives. All the information about the requirement should be "on the table". It should be very clarifying. 

There is then a vote for the point where at the same time, each member flips there card. If the numbers vary, you'll look for end points. That displays there is some ambiguity. 

After the vote, there may be more discussion. Then another vote, and possibly more discussion. By the third vote, there is generally convergance. 

The votes are based on:
 * Disaggregation
 * Analogy
 * Expert opinion
 
The outcome and side effects:
  - Greater understanding of the requirement
  - Expectation setting (what does the client expect?)
  - Implementation hints
  - High level design/architecture discussion
  - Ownership of estimate
