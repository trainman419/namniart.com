Reinventing the Wheel: A tale of RSpec, daring, and intrigue

"What about the current wheel?" 
 - The wheel may not be round enough
 Truly, there are any number of reasons to reinvent the wheel.
 
There's possibly a lack of carving skills. 

Let's build a better wheel.


RSpec: Fancy Pants Testing Framework. It's about Behavior Driven Development. 

RSpec 1 Common complaints:
  * Too much magic!
  * Hard to extend
  * Slower than other options
  
Why not contribute?

Chad joins Relevance.
Rob Sanheim complained a lot about RSpect.
Chad started a simpler, easier version for Rob out of spite.

"That will show him!"

Common test were much, much faster. 

Micronaut was born! And it was instantly compatible with RSpec.

The relevance team began working on micronaut, and then began talking to Dave Chelemski about the end points between RSpec 1 and Micronaut.

After Dave agreed to merge the code, there was a great speed increase. 

# RSpec 2

## How did it come to be

"Right Place, Right Time"

It's better to show your projects early. 

Still in beta, work is going on. 

The core team is: Dave Chelimsky, Chad Humphries, Yehuda Katz, and Carl Lerche. 

## Feel good takeaways
**Reinvent to have fun**
**Experiment when reinventing**
**Never be afraid to try**
