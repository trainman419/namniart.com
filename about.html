<h2>About</h2>

<p>I little about me: I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and I'm currently working as a roboticist and systems administrator in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>When I have free time, I spend most of it working on electronics projects, building robots, and hanging out at the <a href="http://www.hackerdojo.com/">Hacker Dojo</a>.</p>
