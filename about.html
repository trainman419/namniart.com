<h2>About</h2>

<p>I little about me: I'm currently a student at Cal Poly, working on finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I work part-time as a sysadmin for zme.com with some of the most awesome people I know.</p>

<p>Somehow I manage to have free time, and I spend most of it working on electronics projects, building robots or playing with linux.</p>
